// ! Answer
//synchronous functions: are straightforward but can lead to performance issues in applications that require responsiveness.

//Asynchronous functions: on the other hand, provide a way to handle time-consuming operations without blocking the execution of other code, making them essential for modern web development and applications that require high performance.
